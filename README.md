# startup

Change from my development environment!

Change from GitHub

Another change from environment and github

Note from git Assignment:
I think github is very helpful not only for cs260 course, but also for any other projects that I might do on the future.
The fact that many people can work on same projects at their own developement environment, and just push and pull the changes we've made is so fascinating!
